Dump petrol


1. What is the total amount of petrol in volume sold by every distributer?

totalgroup = GROUP petrol by (DistributerName)
totalpetrol = FOREACH totalgroup GENERATE SUM(petrol.volumeOUT);

2. Which are the top 10 distributers ID's for selling petrol? Also display the amount of petrol sold in volume.

OrderPetrol = ORDER petrol by volumeOUT DESC
FilterPetrol = LIMIT OrderPetrol 10;


OrderPetrol = ORDER totalgroup by volumeOUT DESC

3. List 10 years where consumption of petrol is more with the distributer id who sold it.

morepetrol = FOREACH petrol GENERATE DistrictId, DistributerName, year, volumeIN-volumeOUT as total;
orderpetrol = ORDEr morepetrol by total DESC;
filorder = FOREACH orderpetrol GENERATE year;
limitpetrol = LIMIT filorder 10


4. Find the distributer name who sold petrol in least amount.

B = FOREACH petrol GENERATE DistributerName, REPLACE(sellrate,'[$]','') as sellratee;
C = FOREACH B generate DistributerName, (double)sellrate;
D = GROUP C by DistributerName;
E = FOREACH D GENERATE group, MIN(C.sellrate);
